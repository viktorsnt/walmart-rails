== README

I chose rails for rapid development. I tried to use react but react-router has some issues with server-side rendering.

Requirements

* ruby version 2.3.1
* rails 4.2.6
* postgresql

To run the application
	
	cd walmart-rails
	bundle install
	rake db:create
	rake db:migrate
	rails server

And go to http://localhost:3000
